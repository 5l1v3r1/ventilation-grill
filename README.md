# Description


### What is an SLDPRT file?

"A SLDPRT file is a 3D image format used by SolidWorks CAD software. It contains a 3D object or "part" that may be combined with other parts into a single assembly (.SLDASM) file."

### What is Sheet Metal?

This feature allows you to quickly create sheet metal part designs using a simple design process, saving you time and development costs, thanks to specific sheet metal features. We can use these features to create sheet metal designs with several different methods. Here we focused on the vent method.
